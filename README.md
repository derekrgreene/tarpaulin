# üìò TARPAULIN

Tarpaulin is a lightweight course management tool. The Tarpaulin REST API has 13 endpoints, most of which are protected. The protected endpoints require a valid JWT in the request as Bearer token in the Authorization header. Each user in Tarpaulin has one of three roles: admin, instructor, and student.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of four main components:

1. **Flask Backend**: REST API endpoints to interact with courses, users, and student enrollments
2. **Auth0 Authentication/Authorization**: OAuth authentication -> JWT 
3. **Google Cloud Datastore**: NoSQL Database for storing users, courses, enrollments
4. **Google Cloud Storage**: Object storage for storing user avatar image files
